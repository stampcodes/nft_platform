# Quantum Mad Labs NFT

## Overview

**Quantum Mad Labs NFT** is a blockchain-based platform that allows users to connect their wallet, purchase non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and view their purchase history in a secure and decentralized environment.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into several parts, each detailed in the respective README files:

- **Frontend:** User interface developed in React, allowing users to connect their wallet, purchase NFTs, and view their transaction history.
- **Smart Contract:** A smart contract written in Solidity that manages the creation and exchange of NFTs on the blockchain. The contract also includes auction functionality, though this feature is not yet implemented in the frontend.
